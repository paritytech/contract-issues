# Bug Tracker for Contracts on Polkadot Hub

The contract solution on Polkadot Hub consists of many components. The repository
exists so that users and developers have a single point of contact to report
issues.

Issues reported here will then either be moved to the correct component or turned
into meta issues in case they impact multiple components.

View the [issue tracking board](https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/198/views/14) to see the current status of all reported issues.
