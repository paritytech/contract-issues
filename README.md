# Contracts on AssetHub Bug Tracker

The contract solution on AssetHub consists of many components. The repository
exists so that users and developers have a single point of contact to report
issues.

Issues reported here will then either be moved to the correct component or turned
into meta issues in case they impact multiple components.
